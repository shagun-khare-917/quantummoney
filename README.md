# Quantum Money and the No-Cloning Algorithm


Today, we utilize two basic forms of money: the type we carry around and the type we entrust to someone else. The type we carry around includes coins, bank notes, poker chips, and precious metals. These are objects that are made by a mint and can be counterfeited easily by using the same production process as the one used to make the original. The other kind of money is the kind that you entrust to someone else. This is where bank accounts, credit card lines, and checks  come into play where you instruct the bank to move money on your behalf. However, this form of money has its own disadvantages: every time you pay someone, you need to tell your bank whom to send money to. This process leaves a paper trail and has high risk if your connection to the bank is not secure. This is where quantum money comes into play. A quantum money scheme is a quantum cryptographic protocol to create and validate banknotes which are impossible to forge. The key idea is that arbitrary quantum states cannot be perfectly copied, otherwise known as the no-cloning theorem. Utilizing this idea, quantum money schemes produce banknotes which are impossible to forge by including quantum systems in their design.
